### 🧭 Overview

Today I learned the **foundations of Kubernetes** — how it manages containerized applications, scales workloads, and ensures reliability.
The course walked through everything from pods and deployments to services, YAML specs, and even CRI-O runtime setup.

### 📂 Core Concepts

#### 🧱 What is Kubernetes?

* Open-source **container orchestration platform**.
* Automates **deployment, scaling, and management** of containers.
* Works across clusters of servers (nodes).

#### 📦 Pod

* Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
* Encapsulates one or more containers.
* All containers in a pod share the same network namespace and storage.

#### 🧩 Cluster & Nodes

* **Cluster:** Entire Kubernetes system.
* **Master Node (Control Plane):** Manages the cluster (scheduling, scaling, etc.).
* **Worker Nodes:** Run application workloads (pods).

#### 🌐 Services

* Stable networking endpoints for pods.
* Types:

  * `ClusterIP` → Internal communication within the cluster.
  * `NodePort` → Exposes app on `<NodeIP>:<Port>` externally.
  * `LoadBalancer` → Integrates with cloud load balancers for production.

#### 🧰 kubectl

* Command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes.
* Used for creating, managing, and inspecting cluster resources.

### ⚙️ Setup Steps

1. **Install kubectl**

   ```bash
   brew install kubectl          # macOS
   choco install kubernetes-cli  # Windows
   ```
2. **Install Minikube**

   ```bash
   brew install minikube
   ```
3. **Start cluster**

   ```bash
   minikube start
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
4. **Create Pod**

   ```bash
   kubectl run myapp --image=nginx
   kubectl get pods
   ```
5. **Expose Deployment**

   ```bash
   kubectl expose deployment myapp --type=NodePort --port=80
   minikube service myapp
   ```

### 📋 Common Commands Cheat Sheet

| Action            | Command                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| List nodes        | `kubectl get nodes`                           |
| List pods         | `kubectl get pods`                            |
| Create deployment | `kubectl create deployment app --image=nginx` |
| Scale deployment  | `kubectl scale deployment app --replicas=3`   |
| Delete pod        | `kubectl delete pod pod-name`                 |
| View logs         | `kubectl logs pod-name`                       |
| Describe pod      | `kubectl describe pod pod-name`               |
| Apply YAML        | `kubectl apply -f file.yaml`                  |
| Delete resources  | `kubectl delete -f file.yaml`                 |

### 🧱 YAML Example — Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

* Kubernetes abstracts infrastructure and focuses on **desired state management**.
* **Pods** are ephemeral — **Deployments** handle their lifecycle.
* **Services** provide stable networking for dynamic pods.
* YAML files make deployments **reproducible and version-controlled**.
* Tools like **Minikube** help simulate real clusters locally.

### 💬 Reflection

Kubernetes initially felt intimidating, but breaking it down step-by-step made it clearer.
It’s like a **traffic controller for containers** — handling who runs where and when, automatically.
I think I am ready to deep dive in real world project with kubernetes.
